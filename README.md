# Instagram-User-Analytics

## Introduction
This project encapsulates the findings of the comprehensive analysis of user interactions and engagements on Instagram.

The aim of this project was to carry out an analysis of Instagram user data for the purpose of generating insights that may be helpful for the management team to make informed decisions about the future of the Instagram app.

The tools used for this project were SQL and MySQL Workbench, which were used to analyse the data and answer the questions posed by the management team.

## Approach
For the execution and completion of this project, the first approach was to explore various tables and the relationships between various tables. The fields in various tables were analysed to understand the data given in each table. Then, I explored how each table is related to other columns and the reference columns for the given relationship.

Once I made sense of the given data, I began writing SQL queries to answer the posed questions. For each question, I identified the key information that is needed to answer the question, the columns that will be needed to get the complete information, the tables that will be relevant for answering the questions, and the relationships between these tables.

## Tech-Stack Used
For this project, I used MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE. It was chosen because it is a UI for MySQL. For the project, I used it to create the database from the database creation commands, access the tables and the list of columns from the visual interface, write SQL queries, and display the output.

## Insights
At the completion of the analysis, we found the relevant information to answer all the questions that will help make informed decisions for the marketing of the products. We also find key metrics for the investors that will help them predict the future of the platform from the current user data.

The data was used to find the most loyal users who have been on the platform for the longest time. The users found from this analysis can be rewarded for their loyalty as a marketing campaign. The top 5 most loyal users are
* Nicole71
* Jordyn.Jacobson2
* Emilio_Bernier52
* Elenor88
* Darby_Herzog

I found the most inactive users who havenâ€™t posted a single photo on Instagram. There are a total of 26 inactive users. To encourage the users to start posting, the marketing team can send promotional emails and reminders to these users. This is a useful insight to encourage user engagement and posting on Instagram.

The marketing team had organised a contest where the user with the most number of likes on a single post. I found the winner and their details. The winner is Zack_Kemmer93 who had 48 likes on his photo with photo id 145. This will help the marketing team promptly announce the winner and reward them with the contest prize.

As a part of the marketing analysis, I also found out the most frequently used hashtags under the posts. The most popular hashtags are:
* smile
* beach
* party
* fun
* concert

The partner company can use these popular hashtags to gain more user engagement and reach.

I also found out the day of the week when the most number of users registered to Instagram. The best day of the week to launch the ad campaign is Thursday. The finding of this analysis gives valuable information to the marketing team to launch ads to increase the reach.

Next, I gained insights into the important investors' metrics, such as the average posts per user. The average number of posts per user is 3.4730. This is a key metric to encapsulate the level of user activity on the platform.

Next, I found a number of users who have likes on all of the posts on the platform. These users are likely to be bot accounts. And getting rid of such bot accounts is important from the platform management and investment perspective. There are a total of 13 such users in the user data.

## Result
At the completion of the project, I gained valuable knowledge and insights to answer the important questions of the management team. The gained insights from this analysis will help the management team to make informed decisions to draw Instagram towards growth. After carrying out the comprehensive analysis, I am able to infer and answer a diverse set of questions. 

## Drive Link
This project has given me the opportunity to delve deeper into the dataset and carry out analysis using SQL. At the end of the project, I have familiarized myself with how to leverage MySQL Workbench to carry out such analysis from a database. The gained insights will be helpful in showcasing my data analysis skills and proficiency in MySQL.
